# OPTIONAL
# GitHub commit status context to use when reporting back
# status updates to GitHub. If omitted, defaults to

context: 'CI Tester'

# OPTIONAL
# Mark this testsuite as required. This causes a special
# "required" context to be reported to GitHub. The result is
# set to successful only if all testsuites marked as

# with multiple (possibly changing) statuses.

# It is possible to specify multiple testsuites by starting
# a second document. All the same fields are supported,
# though the 'context' key must be different.

# Start off by inheriting all the keys from the previous

# them. At least the 'context' key must be overridden. If
# omitted, defaults to false.

# REQUIRED
# A distinct context must be used here.

# As a convenience, specifying one of the 'host',
# 'container' or 'cluster' keys automatically unsets the
